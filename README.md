## Installation
Clone the repo and run
```shell
npm install
```

## Fire up Mongo
In a terminal window run `mongod`
In a 2nd terminal window run `mongo`

If you have errors, be a good dev and figure it out. Most of the issues I ran into with this step were easliy fixable by Googlin'

### Fire up your server 
In yet another terminal window run `nodemon index`

This command will start up your server/api and because I am nice like that, you will also get the benefit of using `nodemon. Now you won't have to stop then restart your server after every change....it will be watching for changes and take care of that for you


Should be fine right....?
